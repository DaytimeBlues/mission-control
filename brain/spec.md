# Product Specification

## Vision
A comprehensive, interactive development planning system that transforms "vibe coding" into a structured, high-fidelity engineering workflow. It leverages an Agentic Triad (Planner, Builder, Tester) to orchestrate software development while keeping the user in the driver's seat as the "Software Architect."

## Core Principles (Z.ai Inspired)
1. **Aesthetic-Usability**: Beautiful designs are easier to use.
2. **Signifiers**: Explicit labels and icons.
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show info on demand.
4. **Chunking**: 5-9 items per group.
5. **Thumbing**: Mobile-bottom navigation.
6. **Feedback Loops**: Immediate response to all actions.
7. **Fitts's Law**: Large targets at edges.
8. **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction of importance.
9. **Skeuomorphic Clues**: Real-world metaphors.
10. **Intent Gates**: Safety checks for destructive actions.

## User Personas
- **The Vibe Coder**: Has ideas but needs structure to execute.
- **The Architect**: Wants high-level control without writing every line of boilerplate.

## Platform
- **Primary**: Mobile (iOS/Android) via Flutter.
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Functions, Auth).
- **Core Intelligence**: Gemini 3 Pro via MCP.
